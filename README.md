#### Nov 2023 - Nov 2023 (3 days) <br>
> - **Project scenario** <br>
A Data Science Coding Competition project that uses a real-world dataset to develop a prediction or classification model. Participants approached the problem using Python and Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on data manipulation, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The competition allowed students to practice their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as gain experience with machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques.
> - **Skills demonstrated** <br>
`Data Science` `Data Analysis` `Python Programming` `Machine Learning`
> - **Tools used** <br>
`Python`
> - **Summary** <br>
Optimized data for balance, removed redundancy and enhanced predictive power using advanced techniques. Achieved project objectives seamlessly.
> - **Solution** <br>
In this project, I addressed data imbalances by configuring predictors to 'balanced' mode. Identified and removed redundant features using Gradient Boosting Classifier for feature selection. Applied One-Hot encoding to convert nominal to numerical data. Achieved optimal model performance through Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search. Overall, successfully streamlined the dataset and achieved project objectives.
> - **Approach** <br>
In carrying out the research, I began with extensive data exploration, resolving imbalances by configuring 'balanced' predictors. Using the Gradient Boosting Classifier, redundant features were identified and eliminated, nominal data was encoded with One-Hot, and feature selection was performed. We refined the model using hyperparameter tuning with grid search to ensure optimal performance and project completion.
